# Task Tracker

In this web application, users have full control. They can add a task by providing its name and time / deadline, also if they like they can choose a colour from five colour groups to categorise it. They can edit and delete the existing tasks, and rearrange a task by dragging it to the desired location. By clicking a colour button, all the tasks in that specific colour category will be displayed. By clicking the time sorting buttons, the tasks will be displayed in either chronological or the reverse chronological order.
